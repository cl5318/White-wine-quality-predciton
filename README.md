### Predicting White Wine Quality Using Machine Learning Models in R

This project aims to predict white-wine quality, using a combination of Machine Learning Regression and Classification Algorithms.

The raw data file is white-wine_rawdata.Rdata, which  is available to download on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

The output of the prediction is quality score, which are integers from 0 to 10. There are 11 wine substances: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH values, sulfates, and alcohol.

## Data split
The raw data is splitted into three datasets: train data;validation data; test data


## Instructions for reproducing  results
1.Download and import the following 3 datasets:

  a) d.train.Rdata
 
  b) d.val.Rdata
 
  c)  d.test.Rdata
  

2.Download and run the following code file:

white-wine-code.R


#### All analyses are implemented using R (version 3.6.1)
